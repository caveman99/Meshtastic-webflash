/**
 *
 * The priority of this message for sending.
 * Higher priorities are sent first (when managing the transmit queue).
 * This field is never sent over the air, it is only used internally inside of a local device node.
 * API clients (either on the local node or connected directly to the node)
 * can set this parameter if necessary.
 * (values must be <= 127 to keep protobuf field to one byte in size.
 * Detailed background on this field:
 * I noticed a funny side effect of lora being so slow: Usually when making
 * a protocol there isn’t much need to use message priority to change the order
 * of transmission (because interfaces are fairly fast).
 * But for lora where packets can take a few seconds each, it is very important
 * to make sure that critical packets are sent ASAP.
 * In the case of meshtastic that means we want to send protocol acks as soon as possible
 * (to prevent unneeded retransmissions), we want routing messages to be sent next,
 * then messages marked as reliable and finally ‘background’ packets like periodic position updates.
 * So I bit the bullet and implemented a new (internal - not sent over the air)
 * field in MeshPacket called ‘priority’.
 * And the transmission queue in the router object is now a priority queue.
 *
 * Protobuf enum <code>MeshPacket\Priority</code>
